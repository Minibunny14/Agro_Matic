## Introduction
Efficient water management is crucial in agriculture to prevent water wastage and ensure optimal crop growth. Traditional irrigation methods often lead to overwatering or underwatering, negatively impacting yield and resource efficiency. This report introduces an automated irrigation control system that leverages real-time sensor data and weather forecasts to determine the precise irrigation needs of crops.

The system consists of soil moisture sensors to measure current moisture levels, an online weather API to retrieve forecasted rainfall data, and a microcontroller-based control unit to process this information. Based on predefined thresholds, the system automatically activates or deactivates the irrigation system for an optimal duration. The report covers the system’s design, integration, performance evaluation, and potential improvements.

## Methodology
### System Design
The design phase focused on integrating soil moisture sensors, a weather API, and a microcontroller to form an efficient irrigation control system. Moisture levels are continuously monitored, and weather forecasts provide predictive insights. A decision-making algorithm determines whether irrigation is necessary and for how long. Below is a diagram of the system:
