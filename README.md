## Abstract  
Traditional irrigation methods waste water and lack real-time adaptability. **AgroMatic** implements a decentralized smart system using ESP-NOW communication between slave nodes and a master hub. Each slave module autonomously monitors soil moisture via capacitive sensors and controls irrigation solenoids, while the master aggregates data and relays it to the cloud. Built on ESP32 microcontrollers, this mesh-network approach reduces water usage by up to 30% while enabling scalable farm deployments.

## Features  
- **Decentralized Control**: Slave nodes operate independently using ESP-NOW protocol.
- **Mesh Network Architecture**: Master ESP32 aggregates data from multiple slave units.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Capacitive soil sensors prevent over/under-watering.
- **Cloud Integration**: Master node exports metrics to IoT platforms (ThingSpeak/Cayenne).
- **Low-Power Operation**: Optimized for battery-powered slave units with deep sleep modes.
- **Modular Design**: Easily add/remove slave nodes without system reconfiguration.
- **Fail-Safe Operation**: Local decision making continues if cloud connectivity is lost.
